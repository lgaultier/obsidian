# Swell Spectrum, L3 SWOT-21 days orbit (CNES, IFREMER, CLS)
This product represent the Swell elevation spectrum from SWOT Karin instrument in Low Resolution (LR) mode at 250m resolution (LR unsmoothed). Therefore the swell elevation spectrum is limited to wavelength larger than 500m, also called long swells or forerunners, typically generated by extreme storms.  SWOT L3 WIND-WAVE datasets are available on CNES / AVISO+ FTP. 

* Samples during specific events
* Institution: IFREMER, CLS

# Swell Partition, L3 SWOT-21 days orbit(CNES, IFREMER, CLS)
This product represent the Swell partition peak wavelength (L18), direction (phi18) and SWH (H18) retrieved from SWOT Karin instrument using 10km box. The peak period is estimated from the peak wavelength by applying the deep-water dispersion relation without currents. The direction is represented by the tail, the SWH by the size of the dot and the wavelength by the color. SWOT L3 WIND-WAVE datasets are available on CNES / AVISO+ FTP.

# SWH Karin, L2 SWOT-21 days orbit (CNES)
This product represent the SWH retrieved from SWOT Karin instrument.
