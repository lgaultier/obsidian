# Sumary of the tasks performed 
# Build a shore-based virtual training
.1 Building on previous OTC activities, design and implement a modular shore-based virtual training
focused on the application of satellite and in situ data for ocean research and applications over
the regions covered by the voyage of Statsraad Lehmkuhl for student during September 2024-
March 2025.

# Manage students registration and participation for each course
For each course, a list of studentsthat were present is made. Students who could not attend had to send an email before the session so that thy can be excused

# Technical support
An on-line technical support clinics was organized to help students who were having issues to install the tools. All of the issues were resolvedeither during this clinics or later by email. 
A support by email was also set up to solve any issue they may encounter during the training. Additional one-to-one clinics were set up to help students who needed help to reinstall the tools during the course.
The main issues encountered were the following:
* Ocean carbon packages needed some fix to be used on recent python version using conda environment
* The installation script did not work on the OneDrive cloud space so we helped students to find a location that is not on this OneDrive 
* A very recent windows computer had an ARM chip, we had to build a specific SEAScope version to support this processor.
* Students were closing the terminal before the installation script finished


# Session recording

All sessions were recorded, edited to provide a shareable videos.
Videos were made available online to students within a day after the lesson on the SharePoint so that students can review them if they miss something or were not available for the Course. 
All videos have been archived here;

# Webex arrangements
Support was provided to ESA in preparing Webex arrangements to implement the course. Testing of the Webex capabilities were made with ESA to explore the option and provide the best solution to students.At least one person from ODL and NERSC were present during each course to help ESA manage the Webex

# Jupyter notebooks
Student were asked to share jupyter notebooks when it was relevant so that we can check that everything was running properly. The results are available in the SharePoint and a summary is available in this sheet:
